### READ ME FIRST

This project has two main folders
    frontend: Currently contains one html file which has just page.
        To run the frontend you don't need to run a server, if you
        are running in the intellij , just run the home.html,
        and ensure the backend which is going to be a server, running.

        TODO: if you wish to deploy in a web server
    backend :
        test.py : use this file to test the suggestions without the need of frontend
        database: contains code that helps connect to mongodb ( needs mongodb to be installed separately.)
        domain: contains domain specific translations

    requirements.txt contains all the necessary packages required to run the backend
